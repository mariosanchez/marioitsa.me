Introduction

Josh introduces the course with the promise of learning CSS in a different way
We use to learn css by memorizing rules that solves specific problems but when problems evolves (designs, trends, etc) we can use the same solutions anymore
So he want us to learn it in deeper way we can join the dots when we se a problem

The first modules is a recap of css basics, with the goal to fill posible gaps in the css knowledge we would need to follow the course. This course is not
meant to be a guide for beginners, but is a good way to ensure all people begins from the same page. You will have a recap on css terminology (which is cool know the name you are already using but probably didn't know), media queries, selectors, combiners, units, typographies...
If you are an experienced web developer and you feel that are confortable enough you may skip this module, but I would recommend do it still since you might found
some specific details you maybe didn't know, for sure you will learn something.

Notes

- The course come with a lot of useful links that Josh shares if we want to deep dive in some topics. Also a lot of resources that he uses himself in his own projects (like his global styles).
- There are a lot of videos explaining more detailed stuff and also giving us advise or tricks.
- In every module we are going to find exercises and quizzes that will challenge us to demonstrate ourselves what have we learnt.
- Josh is a little opinionated in some topics, like in the use of HSL for colors, which he has some good points to use it, but you should take this kind of opinions as what it is, something that you can take or not. The good part is that you will have more reasons whether when to use some thing or the other.
- The course is about building mental models to better understand CSS, most of the time the author tries to bring in similarities with code a experienced JavaScript developer could relate with.
- The course is oriented to work with component libraries rather than use CSS natively.
- The lessons are filled with delightful illustrations that make the course more enjoyable in my opinion, I really appreciate those details.
